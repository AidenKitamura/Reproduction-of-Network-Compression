# Reproduction-of-Network-Compression
This repository includes reproductions for Mobile Net V2, Dynamic Channel Pruning, L1-Norm based Pruning, and Geometric Median Pruning. When doing pruning, all implementations are done according to our report.
# Environment Configuration
Add Environment Config here thank you
# Usage
### Dynamic Channel Pruning
We assume you already switched to MobileNetV2_Dynamic folder
```
python main_cfg.py --rate 0.02 --strategy linear
```
where rate can be specified and strategy can be linear, exp or constant
### L1-Norm based Pruning

### Geometric Median Pruning
